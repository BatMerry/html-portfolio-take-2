 <h1>The Best Movies According to Daniel Michicoff</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
 <hr />

    <h3>Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight Trilogy"</h3>

 <p>Artistic, emotional, entertaining piece of cinema of one of my favorite childhood superheros. Very re-watchable</p>
<h3>The Big Lebowski</h3>
<p>A cult classic but also a perfect movie. Very re-watchable</p>
<h3>Avengers Infinity War/ Endgame</h3>
<p>It took all my movies I love with many different storytelling themes and devices and combined over a decade of movie characters into one satisfying culmination of a movie.  Very re-watchable</p>
